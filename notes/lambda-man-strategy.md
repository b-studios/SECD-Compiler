Basic strategies:
 * move to nearest dot
 
Potential heuristics:
 * prioritize fruit if its close
 * don't enter corridor if ghost is coming toward you
 
Potential generic algorithms:
 * A-star algorithm with ghosts as high-penalty obstacles

High-level domain-specific ideas:
 * wait to eat a power pill if ghosts are close
 * take more risks when time runs low
 * fruit appears at a fixed schedule, so plan accordingly
