ghc:

8-bit uint registers

2 memories: data and code, each with 256 locations
=> program contains at most 256 instructions
=> each line of code is stored at the corresponding code memory location

up to 1024 execution cycles (per game step)

content of data memory and registers persist

8+1 Registers:

PC		program counter
A
B
C
D
E
F
G
H


an argument is either
a register: A
an indirect register: [A] (but not [PC])
a constant: 0
contents of data memory location: [0]


MOV dest, src		dest may not be constant
INC dest			may not be constant or PC
DEC dest			may not be constant or PC
ADD dest, src		dest may not be constant or PC
SUB dest, src		dest may not be constant or PC
MUL dest, src		dest may not be constant or PC
DIV dest, src		dest may not be constant or PC. Error if src=0
AND dest, src		dest may not be constant or PC.
OR dest, src		dest may not be constant or PC.
XOR dest, src		dest may not be constant or PC.
JLT targ,x,y		x<y?PC=targ
JEQ targ,x,y		x==y?PC=targ
JGT targ,x,y		x>y?PC=targ
INT i
HLT

8: debug
	sends contents of PC, A..H to external debug agent
